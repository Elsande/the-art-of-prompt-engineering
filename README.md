Sina	As a data scientist in IBM, I have always been passionate about sharing my knowledge and helping others learn about the field. I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn about data science, regardless of their background or experience level. This belief has inspired me to become a learning content provider, creating and sharing educational materials that are accessible and engaging for everyone.
